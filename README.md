  What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  ABCU wanted to develop an application that could parse, sort, and print courses with their prerequisites.


  How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I chose to implement a hash table for this assignment due to its scalability and speed using a hashing function. Choosing the proper data structure for your project can help you avoid unnecessary loading times and conflicts that may result. 
  
  
  How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  Input validation was something that took a while. I found that loading the .csv file twice would give me duplicates, and that my lask of input validation in the menu would cause an infinite loop. I had to modify the input function to check for duplicates and used cin.clear and cin.ignore to improve the input validation in the menu.
  
  How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  I learned about the diffences between data structures and how to choose the proper one for the situation. I dove deeper into input validation and how to handle loading data sets while avoiding duplication problems

  How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I improved my ability to constuct data structures and to identify problems that could occur in the program. Finding the duplication after loading the data twice helped me avoid that problem.  I impropved my ability to create modular code that can be modified using industry standard naming practices.
